# bikeviz
For PLAN341 I am tasked to making a visualization of how a smart city solution impacts my daily life. In Vancouver, the bike infrastructure has been easily one of the biggest city solutions that has benefitted me. To meditate on this, I'll plot my routes from Strava to see what the city has enabled me to do.
